My current [dot] files.

**NOTE**: Make sure you've got a few stuff before you're expecting things to work out of the box

##### Stuff you'll need

- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
- [antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/)
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)
- [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) / pygmentize
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip)
- [nerdfonts*](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

a few stuff are handled by `install.sh`, some of them include: neofetch, antibody, lsd, chroma (you might need to install it manually), neovim, xclip. While you do need to install the any patched Nerd Font manually.

**NOTE**: If some shell commands like `cat`, `less`, etc. are bugging you please add a backslash `\` before the command. Making it look like `\cat > lulz << EOF`

*You may also use any other **supported** font(s) too :slightly_smiling_face:
